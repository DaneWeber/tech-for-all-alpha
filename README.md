## Git vs. GitHub

- Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
  - CVCS example: [Team Foundation Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/what-is-tfvc?view=azure-devops)
  - One authoritative copy
- Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
  - [git](https://git-scm.com/) is a command-line tool designed for open-source projects
    - Core functionality: create a patch to email to a maintainer
    - There is no authoritative copy: all repoositories are equal
    - See [git diagrams](git-and-branches.md) for more information
  - GitHub provides a hosted git repository that humans treat as authoritative.
    - GitHub provides a web interface with additional functionality.
    - The "Pull Request" is how the server merges patches.
  - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a local GUI for git and interacting with GitHub.
